With the money earned by him from selling his game he could easily have purchased a cartridge belt and pouch, but the thought of making such purchase never even so much entered his head..Yermolay's right cheek was always more swollen than his left..

Yermolay was a man of the most unusual kind: free and easy\ras a bird, garrulous to a fair extent, to all appearances scatter-brained\rand awkward; he had a strong liking for drink, could never settle in\rone place, when on the move he ambled and swayed from side to side\r� and, ambling and swaying, he would polish off between thirty and\rforty miles a day. He had been involved in a most extraordinary\rvariety of adventures, spending nights in marshes, up trees, on roofs,\rbeneath bridges, more than once under lock and key in attics, cellars\rand barns, relieved of his gun, his dog, his most essential clothing,\rreceiving forceful and prolonged beatings � and yet after a short time\rhe would return home clothed, with his gun and with his dog.
